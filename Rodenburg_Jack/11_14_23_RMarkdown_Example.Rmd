## R Markdown 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE} 
#echo=FALSE says "I don't want to see the code AND the result of the code
#echo=TRUE shows both source code AND output
#word after {r ____} is the name of the chunk, shows up in error code if somethings is wrong
#include=TRUE says include this in the knit
#eval=FALSE means you just see the code, it doesn't actually run or produce output
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
