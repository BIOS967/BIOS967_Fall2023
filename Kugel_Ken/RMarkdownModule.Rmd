YAML Header above - marked by the dashes. We can change the output formate to pdf_document or doc_document then click knit again.

Hashmarks (#) control the size of the header!

ctrl+alt+i adds a new chuck

echo=FALSE means you do not want to see the chunk of code

You can also name your chunks ie- ```{r cars} would name the r chunk cars

include= is also an important part. This means you can include=FALSE to skip some code

eval= false shows the chunk but does not run it




```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
